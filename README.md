How To Play:

Changes From The Design Document:

TODO: what did you need to add/remove/modify from the original design? Why?

Good / Bad / Ugly Code:

TODO: provide examples of code you wrote from this project that you think is good (elegant, simple, useful), bad (hack-y, brittle, unreadable), and ugly (particularly inelegant). Provide a sentence or two of justification for the examples.

## Runtime Build Instructions

The runtime code has been set up to be built with [FT Jam](https://www.freetype.org/jam/).

### Getting Jam

For more information on Jam, see the [Jam Documentation](https://www.perforce.com/documentation/jam-documentation) page at Perforce, which includes both reference documentation and a getting started guide.

On unixish OSs, Jam is available from your package manager:
```
	brew install ftjam #on OSX
	apt get ftjam #on Debian-ish Linux
```

On Windows, you can get a binary [from sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/freetype/files/ftjam/2.5.2/ftjam-2.5.2-win32.zip/download),
and put it somewhere in your `%PATH%`.
(Possibly: also set the `JAM_TOOLSET` variable to `VISUALC`.)

### Libraries

This code uses the [libSDL](https://www.libsdl.org/) library to create an OpenGL context, and the [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net) library for OpenGL-friendly matrix/vector types.
On MacOS and Linux, the code should work out-of-the-box if if you have these installed through your package manager.

If you are compiling on Windows or don't want to install these libraries globally there are pre-built library packages available in the
[kit-libs-linux](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-linux),
[kit-libs-osx](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-osx),
and [kit-libs-win](https://github.com/ixchow/kit-libs-win) repositories.
Simply clone into a subfolder and the build should work.

### Building

Open a terminal (or ```x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017``` on Windows), change to the directory containing this code, and type:

```
jam
```

That's it. You can use ```jam -jN``` to run ```N``` parallel jobs if you'd like; ```jam -q``` to instruct jam to quit after the first error; ```jam -dx``` to show commands being executed; or ```jam main.o``` to build a specific file (in this case, main.cpp).  ```jam -h``` will print help on additional options.
